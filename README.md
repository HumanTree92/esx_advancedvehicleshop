# Helpfull Info:
* This Vehicle Shops works exactly like esx_vehicleshop.
* Currently has 9 Different Vehicle Shops.
  * Ambulance, Police, Mechanic, Aircrafts, Boats, Cars, Trucks, & 2 VIP Shops (Boats & Cars)
* To make this Script fully work with `esx_policejob & esx_ambulancejob`
  * edit `client/vehicle.lua` and do a search for `esx_vehicleshop` & change it to `esx_advancedvehicleshop` then edit the `fxmanifest.lua` & remove the dependency for `esx_vehicleshop`.
* You can only sell vehicles at the shop you bought it from.
  * Example: If you a buy a vehicle at the Truck Shop you won't be able to sell it at the Car Shop.
* If you want to use the Ambulance or Police Shop you will need to Edit the sql to your needs before you upload it.
* I have added my VIP Boat & Car Shop but you will need to setup that on your own. There will be no help from me.
* This works perfectly with my esx_advancedgarage. I suggest using it over any other garage system including esx_policejob & esx_ambulancejob Garages.
* New System will pull Vehicle Name & Vehicle Category & save it in the Database. This way you don't need a vehicle_names.lua file.
